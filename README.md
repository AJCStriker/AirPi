AirPi
========

A Raspberry Pi weather station and air quality monitor.

This is the code for the project located at http://airpi.es

Currently it is split into Upload.py, which handles getting all the data together and uploading it to the internet, and a variety of smaller peices of code for getting the data from each of the many sensors attached to the Pi.

Some of the files are based off code for the Raspberry Pi written by Adafruit: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code
